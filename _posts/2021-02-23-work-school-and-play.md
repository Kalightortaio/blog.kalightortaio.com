Ten days have passed, and my progress has been all but spent academically. In my spare time, I took the effort to update some of my mods to fix glaring bugs and push for additional content. I haven't been able to pick up my C++ lessons lately, but I have started a new exercise regime! I don't like being stagnant with my projects, so if I'm unable to move forward in one field, I'll usually carve a different path elsewhere. I've relatively tried to stay healthy during the quarentine, but I'd be lying if my efforts worked. Despite this last year of setbacks in my personal growth, I'm committed to making the best of my future. Still, my schooling dictates a large part of my current week, and is my primary focus in life. I'm currently taking Physics I, and Calculus II.
