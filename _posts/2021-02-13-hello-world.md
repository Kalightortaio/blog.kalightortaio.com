Just finished the sixty-some commits to the github repository to finish setting up this Jekyll run blog. I ultimately went with a minimalist approach to design, despite the several hours I spent tinkering with the CSS. Future commits will be ultimately meaningless as I continue to create new posts. Still, the advent of github pages is a great (and free) boon to webhosting projects. I still want to add label functionality to this blog, so we can differentiate between general posts, and specific projects, like Oryx's Paracosm, my C++ progress, the search for a programming career, et cetera.
